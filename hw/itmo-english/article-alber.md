## Alber the Prince of Monaco

For many centuries monarchs had a great role in their country life. However years have passed and society came to the point of leaving kings and queens far away from the real country management. Still the royal families all over the world remain the great part of cultural heritage. So a quite interesting question is how do these alive exhibits spend their time nowadays?

Born in 1958 Alber Grimaldi is now the reigning monarch of Monaco, one of the most remarkable countries in Europe. Just a couple of words about Monaco: it is located on Cote d'Azur and surrounded with the southern France and due to the mountainous landscape and the tinyness of the very country it has the highest density of population in the world though there are only 37 thousand people. But still they live on the square of 2 km^2! Monaco is well-known for Casino Monte Carlo, which is the greatest sponsor of the state treasury and one of the most famous casino in the world. Because of Monte Carlo, Cote d'Azur prestige and low taxes Monaco attracts many wealthy people, sportsmen, businessmen. It's really all about luxury! Thousands of incredibly expensive cars, boutiques are there on every corner.

But in spite of this imidge Monaco has a great history, which mostly rotates all around the Royal Family Grimaldi. Prince Alber II is a son of Prince Rainier III and American actress Grace Kelly, who was really loved by Monaco people. Alber has a consant residence in Monaco Palace which is one of the most cute palaces I've ever been! It's not very big and has about 15 chambers and each of them is decorated in its own architecture style, however every single thing in the Palace reminds visitors that it is totally dedicated to the Royal Family Grimaldi. The biography of Alber is really astonishing: first of all he is a great sportsman. From the early childhood he was fond of such kinds of sports as handball, swimming, judo, javelin throwing, tennis, rowing, sailing, skiing, squash and fencing. But the most amazing thing is that he participated in bobsleigh at Winter Olympics in Monaco in 1988-1992! Could you imagine a king doing bobsleigh at Olympics??! 

Besides the sports career Alber takes part in many environmental projects. He founded the Zoological Garden of Monaco, was an Intenational Patron of the "Year of Dolphin" in 2007 and even visited the North Pole in order to meet scientists and climate change experts and learn more about the impact of the global warming on the continent. Moreover he once visited a South Pole too what made him the only monarch in history to visit the both Earth Poles! Alber also has a wonderful collection of the royal automobiles starting from the coaches of the latest 19th century and ending with modern Formula 1 sportcars.

Prince Alber is a great example of a very interesting many-sided person who still has an enormous responsibility for being one of the wealthiest royals in the world and a face of the country. All in all, being in Monaco don't miss to visit his Palace!
