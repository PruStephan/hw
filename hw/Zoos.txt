Zoos

Do we really need them? And do they worth all the suffer and pain animals get living in the zoos? That's not a simple question..

Well there are a lot of animal protectors who fight fiercely with the zoos and everything connected with keeping wild animals close to civilization and far away from wild nature. However there is also a huge amount of animal lovers such as zoo workers who do love animals as well as zoos because zoos offer them a job they really like. Moreover who would refuse a kid from going to the zoo on a day out?? So, let's find out should we be violent enough to ban zoos and make all the kids in the world unhappy.
